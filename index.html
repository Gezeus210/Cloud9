<h2 style="color:blue"> What is a Nissan Skyline</h2>
<div class="cars">
<p>The Nissan Skyline is a very reliable and fast racing sports car that was only sold domestically in Japan, however some buyers have been lucky enough to import certain models into the United States. It is an infamous car partly due to the fact that the car appeared in the popular street racing movie,<i>"2 Fast 2 Furious".</i></p>

<h2>What kind of engine does a Skyline use?</h2>
<p>The majority of nissan skylines use an <i title="In-line six cylinder engine.">In-line six cylinder engine.</i></p>
<p>What is an <b>In-line six ?</b> An "in-line six" engine is one that contains six cylinders but going in a straight line rather than taking the other usual shape of the <em>v6 engine</em></p>

<h3>Why is the Nissan Skyline so Popular ?</h3>
<p>The nissan skyline when it first came out became a hit for it's handling and later the power and reliablity of the <span style="background-color:rgb(0,0,255);color:white"> Rb-26 Engine </span></p>
<p>Many skylines you see today may also be trying to copy the signature <span style="background-color:gray;color:white">silver</span> and <span style="background-color:rgb(0,0,255);color:white">royal blue</span> color scheme that was first seen on the infamous Skyline R34 that appeared in "2 Fast 2 Furious". If the speed has not made you a fan of the SKyline model yet, then maybe this article from<a href="https://autospruce.com/best-most-popular-jdm-cars-engine/" target="_blank"> Autospruce.com </a>will convince you.</p>
<p>On the site the following models are mentioned as being the most reliable JDM(Japanese Domestic Market) vehicles.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Nissan Silvia.</li>
  <li>Nissan Skyline GT-R.</li>
  <li>Nissan GT-R R35.</li>
</ol>

<p>These models were listed with other famous vehicles such as the Honda s2000 and Mazda RX-7</p>

<p>What is amazing though is that each jdm manufacturer, Mazda, Honda, Suburu, has their version of the skyline. Meaning each company has their own staple race car, and most of them have appeared in the Fast and Furious franchise just like the Skyline.</p>
