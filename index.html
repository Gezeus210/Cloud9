      <h1>What is Photogrpahy</h1>
      <p>Photography is the capturing light through a camera light sensor to produce an image.</p>
      <br>
      <h1>Quick History</h1>
      <p>During the year 1827, a french scientist named Joseph Nicephore Niepce created the first "photograph" by engraving a metal plate, coating it with bitumen (asphalt) and then exposing it to light. The timeline for photography started with the first picture which was captured in 1827, kodak then began selling the first commercially used camera in 1888. WW2 introduced a new style of photography which in turn opened doors for more styles to be developed. Polaroid in 1948 introduced instant image development and finally the first professional digital camera is developed in 1991. </p>

	  <h1>When Photography Changed</h1>
	  <p>During WW2, there was an introduction of wartime photos which brought forth a new "style" of photography, thus opening a door for new styles to emerge in the field. The field was expanded even further during the 1990s when the first professional digital camera was invented for everyone to use.</p>
